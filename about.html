      Welcome to Toadstools!
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is Kyle Raymond. I am an aspiring engineer, writer, and artist.
      Toadstools is my mushroom patch: poems, graphic poems, Christmas card art -
      a blog post about science or mathematics or the last novel I read
      - whatever I create that manages to fruit and spore might find its way here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also love terrible metaphors. My mind is, indeed, the rotting forest floor
      from which these mushrooms bloom. Or is it a fungus, creeping though detris,
      transforming decay into art?
    </p>
    <p>
      You get the idea. I have an instagram account full of fun, false-start art.
      The code for this site was generated with Jekyll and is hosted on github.

<pre>
The devil's in this Cookie
on this plate right next to me.

The cookie's small, the plate is large,
but the devil's all I see.

I heard the devil's whisper:
"Save this little one for last,"
and not three seconds later
I ate its family fast.

Now I sit, my lips a'tremblin',
powdered sugar on my jaw;
the devil's in this cookie.

(pause)

Now...
the devil's me.

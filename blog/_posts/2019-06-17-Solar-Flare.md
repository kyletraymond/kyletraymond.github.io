A coronal mass ejection - a sun flare - bursts from skin of the sun. The matter is hot, a plasma, and the plasma's electrons and ions flow along magnetic field lines; they are threads of fire spooled around a spindle many times the size of Earth.

Individual threads of light slowly resolve from the glare. The light wavers, thins, sputters.

At last, ionic rain falls down from its spool to the surface of the sun.

It is beautiful.

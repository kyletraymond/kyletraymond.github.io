### Ada Palmer's interview on SingularityWeblog [[link]](https://www.singularityweblog.com/ada-palmer/):

Dr. Ada Palmer should add "Public Intellectual" to her already over-laden hat-rack. In a recent interview on Singularity Weblog, Dr. Palmer strings together multiple lectures on the black death, the Renaissance, how different political or social narratives define "golden ages" for their own ends, and how we might bundle these stories to inform what we do here and now, in our tenuous present.  Dr. Palmer takes complicated, far-ranging subjects and weaves them into sensible patterns, all with a novelist's eye for details, with an historian's eye for contextualization.

Her summary plea at the end of the 2.5 hr interview is for people to realize that teamwork and unheralded, everyday effort drive historical change. In the longer scope of human history, our awareness of global human issues like climate change are new; we haven't been working on the project to mitigate the damage of our blossoming technological capabilities for very long. Make whatever impact you can now, in the company of other people, and don't worry about being remembered like Leonardo da Vinci.  

Dr. Palmer's message is hopeful in the best sense - by facing our many contemporary crises squarely, Dr. Palmer avoids sidestepping how severe issues like climate change and the current COVID-19 pandemic really are. Her optimism is grounded in realism.

Dr. Palmer also argues that the act of writing and reading science fiction is an ethical practice. The application of serious imagination to the world's potentialities exercises ethical frameworks and makes them more resilient. I love how Ada Palmer's science-fiction is a future-history informed by erudite, historically-informed observations of our present moment. The explication of science-fiction's merit is lovely. I've shared the interview with friends and family because it is so damn listenable!

### Marilynne Robinson's article "What Kind of Country Do We Want" in The New York Review of Books [[link]](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/06/11/what-kind-of-country-do-we-want/):

Another long-form historically relevant discussion of the American "now."

### Walnuts for wily squirrel [[link]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFZFjoX2cGg):
For rats with fluffy tails, squirrels are astounding. Give them all walnuts. I wonder how quickly squirrel reaches terminal velocity when they fall?

          <p>Ideas are mushrooms; they eat the dead: ideas and toadstools rise from decay, make order from what was once (but no longer) ordered, what once had gumption but somehow lost the will to live and laid down, fell over, died.</p>

<p>Ideas sprout from old ideas, from old memories, from old conversations poorly half-remembered; and ideas rise up from a deep, buried mesh of life. They fruit, release their spores, and die.</p>

<p>I could continue with this metaphor. I could sustain the note of this metaphor, let it play, let it pass from novelty to annoyance.That’s what I usually do. Bury the joke in senseless repetition; extend the metaphor past its breaking point; let music play, and play, and play, play, play, play, play</p>

<p>That’s what I usually do.</p>

<p>Recently, I watched a show about a sous chief in London who traveled to the eastern countryside of France in order to experience, for herself, the relationship farmers have with the objects of their labor. So she slaughtered boar meat still warm from living, felt curds floating in a bath of whey, and pampered dairy cows with their prominent hip-bones and prized udders.</p>

<p>She was, if I’m honest, a little boring, a little over-enthusiastic in her application of la bise.</p>

<p>She ventured up to a mountain hostel run by a man (with independent wealth) who lived without electricity and cooked with wild nettle, small, tart berries and local, expensive wine. In foraging for dinner, they found edible blue mushrooms and picked them all, small knives squeaking rubber through the stems. She asked, with ecological conservation quivering in her heart, whether or not they might leave a few, not reap too excessively, shouldn’t they leave a few morels (taxonomical accuracy be damned) to spore in peace.</p>

<p>“No! I don’t want anyone else to find this patch! We’ll take them all!”</p>

<p>Indeed, ideas <em>are</em> like mushrooms: the good ones come in troops, and if you leave any fruitful patch unharvested, some unscrupulous soul will come and make off with the remainder of your tasty morsels.</p>

<p>And they will be fed. They will grow strong. They will live.</p>
